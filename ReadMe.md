# Signal processing tools

Package to perform operation in time signals.

The code includes:

* processing
* window
* spectral subtraction

## processing
Processing creates an object that performs operations in a signal. 
The supported operations are:

* FFT
* Inverse of FFT
* Filtering (high and low-pass)
* Integration

## window
Creates a moving window over a time history signal and performs operations.
The supported operations are:

* FFT
* Integration

## spectral subtraction
To be done
